##PokerMate | Your Smart Sidekick to Poker Wisdom
---

In the magical world of poker, where fortunes change with a flip of a card, along comes PokerMate: an intelligent app that not only teaches you the art but also propels you towards victory. Using PokerMate is simple enough - just upload a picture of your 2 cards and the 3-5 community cards on the deck and let the magic happen. No complex steps or a know-how is needed, just a smooth journey to insightful analysis. 

The tool uses image recognition, segmentation, object detection and probabilistic inference to find the strength of user's hand. So, shuffle the deck, capture those cards, and let PokerMate do the rest.
